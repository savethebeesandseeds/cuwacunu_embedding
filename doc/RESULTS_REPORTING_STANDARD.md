# Embedding results reporting standard

Standard version: 1.1

Agreed: 2026-10-06

Dataset naming/legend extension: 2026-10-09. Applies to new reports; preserve
historical frozen reports, cards and source captures.

Report what the encoder contributes through fixed classifier heads. Show task
performance separately from reconstruction progress and training cost. Use
[stable model tags](EMBEDDING_VERSIONS.md) with short descriptions.

## Report structure

Each final update contains results, what changed, and what to do next. Say
"No new experiment" when reusing measurements. For a planning-only update,
identify planned measurements without inventing scores.

Before the tables, identify the task and evidence stage, training/validation/test
examples **per run**, independent source groups, number of encoder runs, batch
size, device, encoder update budget, classifier recipes, and evaluation protocol.
Paired transformations are two examples from one source; three readout fits on
one checkpoint are not three independently trained encoders.

Use simple registered labels to distinguish trained run groups. For RPB-v7,
`RPB-v7` identifies the preserved original instances, while
`RPB-v7.alt-01` identifies fresh retrainings of the same recipe. Use those labels
in comparisons, keeping descriptions beside the table. Different
datasets/seeds are separate experiments; do not describe their scores as changes
to the original saved weights or silently replace the frozen reference.

Use one task per quality table. Do not average direction, level, amplitude, and
timing into a single encoder score. Longer reports may put detailed per-run
scores, uncertainty, and provenance in linked artifacts.

## Dataset names and table legends

Use the stable dataset codename and short recipe in
[the dataset registry](DATASET_REGISTRY.md). Dataset identity is separate from
encoder identity, run seeds, split sizes, classifier budgets and evidence stage.
`TEMPO-*` names lag-sign timing recipes only; amplitude uses its own `AMP-*`
family. Do not call every synthetic task TEMPO.

Put a compact dataset legend immediately beside **every new result table**,
including quality, training, per-cohort, uncertainty, diagnostic and cost tables.
Repeat the legend for each table rather than relying on an earlier section:

> Dataset: **TEMPO-1** · timing · **complexity 1/5** · fixed period16, delay2.

> Dataset: **AMP-1** · amplitude · **complexity 1/5** · paired0.5×/2× sine.

> Dataset: **TEMPO-3** · timing · **complexity 4/5** · variable delay,
> gains/offsets and 3-tick channel gaps.

Include the scored view, for example intact VALIDATION or extra30% coordinate
deletion, beside the legend. For a timing-trained encoder evaluated on amplitude,
say `Fit: TEMPO-1; score: AMP-1`, with both numeric levels. A cost table spanning
tasks must list every relevant dataset in its legend; do not invent one combined
complexity. Split/source counts, head recipes and budgets remain explicit nearby.

Complexity is an **ordinal designed challenge level**, fixed before measurement.
It is neither a mathematically measured quantity nor derived from accuracy,
observability, coverage, audit checks, TEST access or compute. Level4 is not
twice level2, and levels across different task families do not establish equal
intrinsic difficulty. Keep analytic task-information checks separately labelled.
Never relabel a frozen dataset because scores are high or low. A changed signal
recipe gets a new dataset identity and prospective specification.

For one dataset, retain the standard five quality/training columns below and
identify the dataset in its legend. Add a **Dataset** column only when rows from
multiple datasets appear in one table. Continue to keep different tasks in
separate quality tables. If comparing several timing recipes together, list each
codename/level/short recipe in the adjacent legend; show its codename in each row.
Do not add a complexity column to routine single-dataset tables.

New durable JSON records should carry `dataset_id`, `task`, `recipe_id`,
`designed_complexity_level`, `complexity_scale_max` (5), and `view` for each
table/panel, plus distinct fitting/scoring dataset identities for transfer.
Keep the exact generator source, prospective card, source-group/split IDs and
dataset artifact hashes in provenance. The codename is a readable handle for
that fixed recipe, not a substitute for these identities.

## Quality table

Use only the registered model label in encoder rows, including `.alt-NN` when
comparing a separate run group. Place its short embedding
description in prose immediately above or below the table.

| Method | Size | Linear head % | Neural head % | Coverage % |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Raw data — no encoder | Declared | — | — | — |
| PCA only — no encoder | Declared | — | — | — |
| Registered model tag | Declared | — | — | — |

- **Method:** the representation-producing method. Head choice is a column.
- **Size:** numbers supplied to a head, including appended masks or metadata.
  This is not the hidden width of the encoder or decoder.
- **Linear head %:** correct linear/ridge predictions divided by valid evaluated
  examples, multiplied by 100. This is conditional accuracy when support differs.
- **Neural head %:** the same accuracy for the fixed small neural classifier.
- **Coverage %:** valid evaluated examples divided by the entire declared scoring
  population (validation or test), multiplied by 100. It is not confidence or
  accuracy.
- **—:** not measured under the stated conditions. **N/A:** not applicable.
  Unsupported fits are named explicitly rather than scored as zero.

Keep head architectures and training recipes fixed. The present linear recipe
is ridge with penalty 1. The neural recipe is 16 tanh hidden units, Adam at 0.01,
and 100 updates. Fit each head's weights and normalizer only on its permitted
training data. Use paired declared initialization seeds for equal-size inputs;
never choose the best head seed or retune a head after seeing final scores.
At size 32 these heads have 66 and 562 fitted parameters respectively; larger
raw inputs have larger heads, which must be disclosed.

The primary encoder row uses the exact native served export, with training-only
normalization permitted. No PCA or random projection follows an encoder in this
comparison. The PCA-only baseline fits its normalization and PCA on raw training
observations and then sends those components to the same heads. Set its width
equal to the active encoder's native width for the main compact comparison.
Raw data remains a larger-input reference; an analytic rule is a separately
labelled solvability check, not a trained classifier result.

With unequal support, report each method's coverage, the common population for
the paired comparison, and full-population correctness or the card's declared
abstention utility. Include valid/total counts when coverage differs. A high
conditional accuracy on a small retained subset is not a full-population result.
For multiple encoder runs, report the mean and relevant spread. Conditional
source-group intervals and variation across retraining are different quantities.

## Training table

| Encoder | Updates | Train error ↓ | Validation error ↓ | GPU training seconds |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Registered model tag | — | — | — | — |

- **Updates:** completed optimizer weight updates, with attempts/skips retained
  separately. Report the encoder and classifier budgets separately.
- **Train error:** mean absolute reconstruction error on a fixed hidden-target
  query over training observations.
- **Validation error:** the same error on held-out validation observations,
  using training-fitted scales and a fixed query. Lower is better.
- **GPU training seconds:** synchronized cumulative encoder training time;
  excludes fitting classifiers, extraction, scoring, stress tests, and artifact
  writing. Times are descriptive unless a repeated cost benchmark is declared.

Name the error metric and units. The RPB track currently uses standardized MAE.
Retain the actual optimization loss, its name/components, and its trace in the
training artifacts. A final randomly masked minibatch loss is not the fixed
train error. Different objectives or scalers cannot be ranked by one generic
"loss" number.

Reconstruction error measures the encoder/decoder training route. Describe its
capacity when it changes: RPB-v2 reconstructs through three 32-number channel
vectors, while RPB-v4 reconstructs solely through its 32-number global export.
A lower reconstruction error does not establish a better classification embedding.
Other encoder families need their own applicable optimization diagnostics.

Use updates as the main training count. RPB samples rows with replacement and
fresh masks, so it has no exact full-pass epoch counter. If useful, report
equivalent presentations as sampled rows divided by available training rows.
For 512 completed, unskipped updates at batch size 8 and 256 training examples,
this is 4096 / 256 = 16 equivalent passes, not 16 guaranteed complete epochs.

## Changes and next action

Describe the encoder/configuration change, why it was made, and what the tables
support. Distinguish a new architecture, a new training run, a reporting change,
and reused evidence. State unresolved tradeoffs and the experimental/default
status. Identify the next concrete comparison before proposing another loss or
architecture. Parameter count, memory, and inference time accompany decisions
where model cost matters; they need not widen every routine table.

Keep older versions out of routine retraining. A frozen reference can appear in
a named historical comparison, but is not a newly matched training control for
another dataset. Every final number remains traceable to a protocol, checkpoint,
resolved configuration, source revision, and run artifact.
